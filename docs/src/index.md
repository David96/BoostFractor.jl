# BoostFractor.jl

MadMax electrodynamics simulation in Julia.

## 1D Calculations
[1D Code](1d_model.md) based on impedance transformation / 1D ray tracing.

All 3D Codes below generalize also to 1D, but may be less performant.

## 3D Calculations


## Disk Position Optimization
[1D Code](1d_model.md) also contains some examples how to use julia to do optimizations (of the disk spacings for example).
